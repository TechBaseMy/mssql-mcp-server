## üß† Effective Prompting & Tool Usage Guide

When working with Claude or other AI assistants through this MCP server, the way you phrase your requests significantly impacts the results. Here's how to help the AI use the database tools effectively:

### Basic Tool Call Format

When prompting an AI to use this tool, follow this structure:

```
Can you use the SQL MCP tools to [your goal]?

For example:
- Check what tables exist in my database
- Query the Customers table and show me the first 10 records
- Find all orders from the past month
```

### Essential Commands & Syntax

Here are the main tools and their correct syntax:

```javascript
// Discover the database structure
mcp_SQL_mcp_discover_database()

// Get detailed information about a specific table
mcp_SQL_mcp_table_details({ tableName: "YourTableName" })

// Execute a query and return results
mcp_SQL_mcp_execute_query({ 
  sql: "SELECT * FROM YourTable WHERE Condition", 
  returnResults: true 
})

// Find tables by name pattern
mcp_SQL_mcp_discover_tables({ namePattern: "%pattern%" })

// Access saved query results (for large result sets)
mcp_SQL_mcp_get_query_results({ uuid: "provided-uuid-here" })
```

**When to use each tool:**
- **Database Discovery**: Start with this when the AI is unfamiliar with your database structure.
- **Table Details**: Use when focusing on a specific table before writing queries.
- **Query Execution**: When you need to retrieve or analyze actual data.
- **Table Discovery by Pattern**: When looking for tables related to a specific domain.

### Effective Prompting Patterns

#### Step-by-Step Workflows
For complex tasks, guide the AI through a series of steps:

```
I'd like to analyze our sales data. Please:
1. First use mcp_SQL_mcp_discover_tables to find tables related to sales
2. Use mcp_SQL_mcp_table_details to examine the structure of relevant tables
3. Create a query with mcp_SQL_mcp_execute_query that shows monthly sales by product category
```

#### Structure First, Then Query
```
First, discover what tables exist in my database. Then, look at the structure
of the Customers table. Finally, show me the top 10 customers by total purchase amount.
```

#### Ask for Explanations
```
Query the top 5 underperforming products based on sales vs. forecasts,
and explain your approach to writing this query.
```

### SQL Server Dialect Notes

Remind the AI about SQL Server's specific syntax:

```
Please use SQL Server syntax for pagination:
- For offset/fetch: "OFFSET 10 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY"
- For cursor-based: "WHERE ID > last_id ORDER BY ID"
```

### Correcting Tool Usage

If the AI uses incorrect syntax, you can help it with:

```
That's not quite right. Please use this format for the tool call:
mcp_SQL_mcp_execute_query({ 
  sql: "SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Region = 'West'",
  returnResults: true
})
```

### Troubleshooting Through Prompts

If the AI is struggling with a database task, try these approaches:

1. **Be more specific about tables:** "Before writing that query, please check if the CustomerOrders table exists and what columns it has."

2. **Break complex tasks into steps:** "Let's approach this step by step. First, look at the Products table structure. Then, check the Orders table..."

3. **Ask for intermediate results:** "Run a simple query on that table first so we can verify the data format before trying more complex analysis."

4. **Request query explanations:** "After writing this query, explain what each part does so I can verify it's doing what I need."

## üîé Advanced Query Capabilities

### Table Discovery & Exploration

The MCP Server provides powerful tools for exploring your database structure:

- **Pattern-based table discovery**: Find tables matching specific patterns
  ```javascript
  mcp_SQL_mcp_discover_tables({ namePattern: "%order%" })
  ```

- **Schema overview**: Get a high-level view of tables by schema
  ```javascript
  mcp_SQL_mcp_execute_query({ 
    sql: "SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, COUNT(*) AS TableCount FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES GROUP BY TABLE_SCHEMA" 
  })
  ```

- **Column exploration**: Examine column metadata for any table
  ```javascript
  mcp_SQL_mcp_table_details({ tableName: "dbo.Users" })
  ```

### Pagination Techniques

The server supports multiple pagination methods for handling large datasets:

1. **Offset/Fetch Pagination**: Standard SQL pagination using OFFSET and FETCH
   ```javascript
   mcp_SQL_mcp_execute_query({ 
     sql: "SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY Username OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY" 
   })
   ```

2. **Cursor-Based Pagination**: More efficient for large datasets
   ```javascript
   // Get first page
   mcp_SQL_mcp_execute_query({ 
     sql: "SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Users ORDER BY Username" 
   })
   
   // Get next page using last value as cursor
   mcp_SQL_mcp_execute_query({ 
     sql: "SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Users WHERE Username > 'last_username' ORDER BY Username" 
   })
   ```

3. **Count with Data**: Retrieve total count alongside paginated data
   ```javascript
   mcp_SQL_mcp_execute_query({ 
     sql: "WITH TotalCount AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total FROM Users) SELECT TOP 10 u.*, t.Total FROM Users u CROSS JOIN TotalCount t ORDER BY Username" 
   })
   ```

### Complex Joins & Relationships

Explore relationships between tables with join operations:

```javascript
mcp_SQL_mcp_execute_query({ 
  sql: "SELECT u.Username, u.Email, r.RoleName FROM Users u JOIN UserRoles ur ON u.Username = ur.Username JOIN Roles r ON ur.RoleId = r.RoleId ORDER BY u.Username"
})
```

### Analytical Queries

Run aggregations and analytical queries to gain insights:

```javascript
mcp_SQL_mcp_execute_query({ 
  sql: "SELECT UserType, COUNT(*) AS UserCount, SUM(CASE WHEN IsActive = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ActiveUsers FROM Users GROUP BY UserType"
})
```

### Using SQL Server Features

The MCP server supports SQL Server-specific features:

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
- **Window functions**
- **JSON operations**
- **Hierarchical queries**
- **Full-text search** (when configured in your database)

3. The query is executed via functions in `database.mjs`, with possible pagination from `pagination.mjs`
4. Results are formatted and returned to the client
5. Any errors are caught and processed through `errors.mjs`
6. All operations are logged via `logger.mjs`

This architecture ensures:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive logging
- Efficient database connection management
- Scalable query execution

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration Explained

The `.env` file controls how the MS SQL MCP Server connects to your database and operates. Here's a detailed explanation of each setting:

```
# Database Connection Settings
DB_USER=your_username           # SQL Server username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password       # SQL Server password
DB_SERVER=your_server_name_or_ip
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name

# Server Configuration
PORT=3333                       # Port for the HTTP/SSE server to listen on
HOST=0.0.0.0                    # Host for the server to listen on, e.g., 'localhost' or '0.0.0.0'
TRANSPORT=stdio                 # Connection method: 'stdio' (for Claude Desktop) or 'sse' (for network connections)
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3333 # Base URL when using SSE transport. If HOST is '0.0.0.0', external clients use http://<your-machine-ip>:${PORT}

# Advanced Settings
DEBUG=false                     # Set to 'true' for detailed logging (helpful for troubleshooting)
QUERY_RESULTS_PATH=/path/to/query_results  # Directory where query results will be saved as JSON files
```

### Connection Types Explained

#### stdio Transport
- Use when connecting directly with Claude Desktop
- Communication happens through standard input/output streams
- Set `TRANSPORT=stdio` in your .env file
- Run with `npm start`

#### HTTP/SSE Transport
- Use when connecting over a network (like with Cursor IDE)
- Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication
- Set `TRANSPORT=sse` in your .env file
- Configure `SERVER_URL` to match your server address
- Run with `npm run start:sse`

### SQL Server Connection Examples

#### Local SQL Server
```
DB_USER=sa
DB_PASSWORD=YourStrongPassword
DB_SERVER=localhost
